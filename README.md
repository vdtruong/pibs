This unit can read 8 temperatures sequentially.
The temperature sensors could be the same or different.
These are IIC temperature sensors.
Also, the results could be logged to the PC using UART.
The longest cable distance is 25 feet for now.

I have also tested it with two IIC differential chips.
I was able to read the sensor with 500 feet of cable.
This was also tested on an IR temperature sensor.
